# I've joined the ~~100~~#30DaysOfCode Challenge

I realized that I (probably) won't have the time or commitment to code for 100 days straight. Here is my attempt (with some acceptions for 30 days - see my rules.md). I feel this is a good start and a tangible way to start off the new year.

1. View [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for #100DaysOfCode.

## Want to change other habits?

Check out [the #100DaysOfX Challenges Project](http://100daysofx.com/). Changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to start is always NOW.

I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which involves a lot of mental activity, try the [#100DaysOfHealth](http://100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/), or [#100DaysOfFitness](http://100daysofx.com/challenges/) challenges. There is so much more on the site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and more!
